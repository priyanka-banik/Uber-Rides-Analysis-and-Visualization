This project delves into Uber ride patterns to uncover key trends and optimize operations. By leveraging SQL for data transformation and Power BI for visualization, it provides valuable insights into ride demand, speed variations, and peak-hour performance.

Key Insights:
Peak Hour Rush – Identifying the busiest hours for Uber rides.
Weekday vs. Weekend Rides – Analyzing demand fluctuations across different days.
Seasonal Trends – Exploring ride volume changes throughout the year.
Rush Hour Slowdowns – Assessing speed variations and delays during peak hours.
This analysis helps enhance efficiency, optimize resource allocation, and improve the overall customer experience.
